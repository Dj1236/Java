types of java language :- java SE , Java EE , Java ME , Java FX  (James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton).
java is high level, object oriented , robust  programming language devloped by sun microsystem in 1995 by
java is the name of the island in indonesia and it was the first coffee name (alternative names are silk . dna , dynamic)
james gossling who is father of java before it is name as Oak but it is registered company so it is named java(coffee)
java supports the WORA(Write Once Read Anywhere )

jdk , jre , jvm are the three imp key components that work together to enable the devlopment and execution of java application
to compile the java code we need tool which is jdk (java development kit )  It includes tools, libraries, and documentation
jdk consist of compiler which is javac which convert the java code into the byte code and 'java ' is intepreter 'jar' used for creating archive files
'javadoc' used to create api documentation
when we type code we have to converted into the byte code(machine executable code) and this is converted in native machine code which is directly executed by  cpu
JVM(java virtual machine ) we have to run the code into the jvm  here we execute the code (byte code) into machine instruction code(native machine code)
jvm is both intepreter and compiler 
firstly jvm loads the code , then verifies the code , then executes the code, and provide the runtime env 
it also manages the memory allocation and deallocation including garbage collection and also uses as security
jvm also called the main method in the code for the execution
jvm have intepreter jit just in time for compliling the byte code into native machine code
you systems need jvm to execute the code 
JRE(java runtime enviorment ) :- it the set of all the tools use to creat the java application also provide the runtime env , it contains the set of libraries
JDK :- it contains the jre + development tools 

java is platform independent while jvm is platform dependent why :- 
it is because of the byte code which is platform independent but we need jvm that converts the code into byte code
java byte code is platform independent but normal java code is platform dependent . we need jvm to execute it
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM. The JVM can choose to interpret the bytecode directly or dynamically
compile it into native machine code for execution. This combination of compilation and interpretation allows Java to achieve platform independence 
while also providing flexibility and performance.

lets see how java works :- when you write the java code java have a compiler called javac it convert into the byte code after compilation 
jvm always search the main method in the file to exectute the code . and when we compile the code we got class file which contains the byte code

what is public static void main ( string args []) :-
public : access specifier which means that the main method can be access from Anywhere by any other classes and methods
static : here static means you dont have to create the object of class to execute it .( the main method belong to the class itself )
void : means that it function does not need any return value of it 
main :- it is the special method of java which is the entry point of java application jvm search for this method
String[] args :- it is the argument for the main method it represent the array of the string args is used to provide input in java program

variables :- variable is the container which hold the value , a variable is assigned with the datatype  ,there are three types of variables
1) local variable 2) static 3) instance 
local variable :- local variable are those variable that are declared with the scope , methds , constructor 
static variable:- they are declared with the static keyword within the class and outside the method 
Static variables are rarely used other than being declared as constants. Constants are variables that are declared as public/private, final, 
and static. Constant variables never change from their initial value.
instance variable :- this variable are declared inside the class and outside of method , it is created when the object is created with new keyword 
each object of the class have the copy of the instance variable 

datatype :- 

in java we called function as method :-

In Java, methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task, and they are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming. Here's an overview of key concepts and examples related to methods in Java:

### Method Structure

A method in Java is defined within a class and has the following structure:

```java
class ClassName {
    returnType methodName(parameters) {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### Example of a Method

Here's a simple example of a method:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Method that returns a greeting
    public String getGreeting(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }

    // Main method to test getGreeting
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        String greeting = myClass.getGreeting("Alice");
        System.out.println(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Access Modifiers**:
   - `public`: The method is accessible from any other class.
   - `private`: The method is accessible only within the class it is defined.
   - `protected`: The method is accessible within the same package and subclasses.
   - (Default) Package-private: The method is accessible only within the same package.

2. **Return Type**:
   - The data type of the value the method returns. If the method does not return a value, the return type is `void`.

3. **Method Name**:
   - A unique identifier for the method within the class.

4. **Parameters**:
   - Inputs to the method, defined within parentheses. If there are no parameters, parentheses are empty.

5. **Method Body**:
   - The block of code that executes when the method is called.

### Method Overloading

Methods can have the same name but different parameters. This is known as method overloading.

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Overloaded methods
    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }

    public void printMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.printMessage(); // Outputs: Hello!
        myClass.printMessage("Hello, World!"); // Outputs: Hello, World!
    }
}
```

### Static Methods

Static methods belong to the class rather than an instance of the class. They can be called without creating an object of the class.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void printStaticMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass.printStaticMessage(); // Outputs: This is a static method.
    }
}
```

### Recursion

A method can call itself. This technique is known as recursion.

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Recursive method to calculate factorial
    public int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        int result = myClass.factorial(5);
        System.out.println(result); // Outputs: 120
    }
}
```

### Method with Variable Arguments

Methods can accept a variable number of arguments using the varargs syntax.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println(number);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.printNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // Outputs: 1 2 3 4 5
    }
}
```

Understanding and using methods effectively is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Java code.
