Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order.
It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
It operates like a line where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
