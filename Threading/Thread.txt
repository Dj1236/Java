multitasking : in lamen words we know that doing multiple tasks at the same time .
it means computer is executing multiple programs parallel
it can be done in two ways :
process based : multiple program at the time
thread based : means multiple threads at a time
process based simply means that u are using ms word and paint both with the context switching 
while in thread it is an instance of program . there can be multiple thread in the program 
so when we by mistake misspell the spelling then we get an error line that is thread that in one program multiple thread is running on it
jyare alag alag process parallel process karti hoi tyare ene process based kevai ane jyare ek program ma multiple thread execute thati hoi tyare 
thread(two thread share same address space, so context switching is easy less expensive ,less cost) vs process :
why MultiThreading : we dont have to wait for the one particular task to complete we can parallel process the other task 
in single threaded environment only one task can be performed at a time. by this reason cpu cycle are wasted 

a thread is an independent sequential path of execution within a program.it is predefined class available in java lang interface
we can create thread in java in two way by extending thread class by implementing runnable interface

Main thread : when any standalone application can run a user thread is automatically created to execute the main method of the application 

Java offers two types of threads: user threads and daemon threads. User threads are high-priority threads. The JVM will wait for any user thread to complete its task before terminating it. 
On the other hand, daemon threads are low-priority threads whose only role is to provide services to user threads
jyare pan user thread nai halti hoi tyare bhale daemon thread halti hoi jvm ene bandh kari dese

user thread and demon thread : if no user thread are running respective to the demon thread it will stop the execution of all the thread

MultiThreading is a process to execute multiple threads at the same time without dependency of the other thread called as MultiThreading.
in MultiThreading cpu is not ideal 
t.sleep is just like settimeout in js 

thread scheduler : it is a part of preprocessor which executes multiple thread on a single processsor randomly
